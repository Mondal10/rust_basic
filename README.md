# Rust Basic

**Description:** Scratching the surface of `rust` files are saved as per the concepts in rust

- Without Cargo:
    - `rustc <filename>` to compile the file.
    - `./<filename>` to run the executable file.

- With Cargo:
    - `cargo init` to initialize the environment for rust.
    - `cargo run` to Compile and Run the file.
    - Files are compiled to path `target/debug/rust_basic.exe`.
    - `cargo build` to build.
    - `cargo build --release` to build for production. (creates a release folder in target).
